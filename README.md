# fed_detect

Trains and re-packages 2 image classification models, for the purposes of detecting the semantic category and rotation of figures embedded in the digital archives of the Federal Register. Both models consist of pre-trained convolutional neural networks and have been shown to perform with very high (>98%) accuracy. This tool is intended to improve the overall readability and discoverability of decades of government documents.
